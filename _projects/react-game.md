Implemented a type-racing game using React. 

<h2> Details </h2>

I developed an engaging type-racing game using React, offering players an interactive way to test and improve their typing speed. The game challenges users to race against time as they type a random set of words displayed on the screen. Built with React's state management and component-based architecture, the game ensures smooth and dynamic interactions.


Since this was a project made for a course, I can provide it privately if contacted at m3damani@uwaterloo.ca

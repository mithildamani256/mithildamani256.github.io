Hello! I'm a fourth-year Honours Computer Science student at the University of Waterloo. Specifically interested in supervised learning, I have developed and fine-tuned neural networks for diverse applications, including image classification and object localization.

Currently, I work as a Machine Learning Engineer at Cynapta, where I design and implement AI-driven solutions, including prompt-engineering ChatGPT-4 for web-content queries, developing a Next.js and TypeScript UI for social media content, and automating markdown generation and screenshot capture with Puppeteer and Cheerio. I also manage chat history functionality and user authentication for over 1,000 users using Firebase.

Outside the classroom, I enjoy lifting weights and playing tennis.

I am actively seeking opportunities for Summer 2025, where I am eager to bring my skills in machine learning and my passion for tech innovation to a new role.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically. -->

Hello! I'm a fourth-year Honours Computer Science student at the University of Waterloo. Specializing in machine learning, I have a robust background in developing and fine-tuning neural networks for diverse applications, including image classification and object localization.
Currently, I am working as a Machine Learning Engineer at Cynapta, where I contribute to developing advanced AI agents that streamline and enhance business processes through automation and intelligent decision-making.
Outside the classroom, I enjoy lifting weights and playing tennis.
I am actively seeking opportunities for Summer 2025, where I am eager to bring my skills in machine learning and my passion for tech innovation to a new role.

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically. -->
